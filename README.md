## Short description

This is a media server made for [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX).

**It is in no way associated with developers of ShareX.**

Current version supports:
* Images
* Gifs
* Videos
* Text
* Files
* URL shortening

## Motivation
ShareX is an excellent tool. Having your own self-hosted media server for it is even better.
It enables your privacy and total control.

However, most of the custom uploaders for ShareX are written in PHP.
It is a good language but only if done properly. Scripts made in a 10-minute timespan could be vulnerable and/or lack functionality.
